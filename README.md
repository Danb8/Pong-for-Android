# Pong-for-Android

This project is not yet complete, but I have the ball bouncing off paddles and the sides so at least I've made progress.

This is my attempt at making a pong game for Android without following any tutorials. I'm sure everything that I've done could be
greatly improved upon, but I'm at least succeeding in making things functional. 

To do list:

Add code that will move the ai paddle.
Display the score of the game somewhere.
End the game after a certain score.
Add a start menu and an options menu.
Maybe make some classes so everything isn't crammed into the main activity.
Look at tutorials/other pong repositories and compare what I've done to what they've done. Learn the differences.
Lock the game to landscape mode. (I thought I had done this but it apparently didn't work!)
Other things.

I had no experience doing most of the things required to make this app, so it was actually kind of tough to figure out. I feel like
I learned a lot, even though I'm sure the way I did this was far from optimal. It was fun, though!
